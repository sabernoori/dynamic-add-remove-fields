   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to view test scenarios

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Create descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-validation-support`
- `bugfix/fix-memory-leak`
- `docs/update-readme`
- `refactor/improve-performance`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes

fix(events): resolve memory leak in event listeners
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

2. Test all scenarios in the `tests/` directory:
   - Basic single group functionality
   - Multiple groups on single form
   - Single groups on multiple forms
   - Multiple groups on multiple forms

3. Test in different browsers:
   - Chrome/Chromium
   - Firefox
   - Safari
   - Edge

### Test Checklist

Before submitting changes, ensure:

- [ ] All existing functionality works
- [ ] New features work as expected
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Code works in supported browsers
- [ ] Performance is not degraded
- [ ] Memory leaks are avoided

### Adding New Tests

When adding new features:

1. Create test HTML files in the `tests/` directory
2. Follow existing naming convention: `scenario{N}-{description}.html`
3. Include comprehensive test cases
4. Document expected behavior

## Submitting Changes
