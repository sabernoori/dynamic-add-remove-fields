```javascript
const fields = new DynamicFields({
    maxFields: 5,
    group: 'education'
});
```

**New (v3.0):**

    console.log('Fields:', count);
};
```

**New (v3.0):**
```javascript
fields.on('fieldAdded', function(event) {
    console.log('Field added:', event.totalFields);
});

// Or use configuration callbacks
const fields = new DynamicFields({
    onFieldAdded: function(newField, fieldCount) {
        console.log('Field added:', fieldCount);
    }
});
```
